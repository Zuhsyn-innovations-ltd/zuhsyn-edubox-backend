---

🔹 **Transport in Unicellular Organisms:**
- No complex transport system needed
- Substances diffuse directly across the cell membrane due to their small size and large surface-area-to-volume ratio

---

🔹 **Transport in Plants:**
1. **Xylem** – Transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to other parts of the plant
   - Movement is one-directional (upward)
   - Process: **Transpiration pull**

2. **Phloem** – Transports food (glucose) from the leaves to other parts
   - Bidirectional movement (up and down)
   - Process: **Translocation**

---

🔹 **Transport in Animals (especially humans):**
- Uses the **Circulatory System** which includes:
  - **Heart** – Pumps blood
  - **Blood Vessels** – Arteries, veins, and capillaries
  - **Blood** – Contains red cells, white cells, platelets, and plasma

**Types of Blood Vessels:**
- **Arteries** – Carry blood away from the heart (oxygenated)
- **Veins** – Carry blood to the heart (deoxygenated)
- **Capillaries** – Tiny vessels where exchange of materials occurs

**Circulatory system is either:**
- **Open** (e.g., insects – blood not always in vessels)
- **Closed** (e.g., humans – blood always in vessels)

---

🔹 **Double Circulation in Humans:**
1. **Pulmonary circulation** – Heart → Lungs → Heart
2. **Systemic circulation** – Heart → Body → Heart
