  title: 'States of Matter',
  content: `
Matter exists in different physical forms known as **states of matter**. The three main states are:

1. **Solid**  
   - Fixed shape and volume.  
   - Particles are closely packed and vibrate in place.  
   - Example: Ice, stone, wood.

2. **Liquid**  
   - No fixed shape but has a definite volume.  
   - Particles are close but can move around.  
   - Example: Water, milk, oil.

3. **Gas**  
   - No fixed shape or volume.  
   - Particles are far apart and move freely.  
   - Example: Air, steam, oxygen.

Other states (not common in everyday life) include:  
- **Plasma** (ionized gas, found in stars)  
- **Bose-Einstein Condensate** (formed at near absolute zero)

**Changes of state** include:  
- Melting (solid → liquid)  
- Freezing (liquid → solid)  
- Evaporation (liquid → gas)  
- Condensation (gas → liquid)  
- Sublimation (solid → gas)

Understanding these changes helps explain many everyday phenomena.

  title: 'Atomic Structure',
  content: `
All matter is made up of **atoms**, which are the smallest units of an element that still retain its properties.

### 🔹 Basic Structure of the Atom:
1. **Protons**  
   - Positively charged (+)  
   - Located in the nucleus  
   - Determines the atomic number

2. **Neutrons**  
   - No charge (neutral)  
   - Also in the nucleus  
   - Helps add mass and stability

3. **Electrons**  
   - Negatively charged (−)  
   - Orbit around the nucleus in energy levels or shells  
   - Involved in chemical bonding

### 🔹 Important Terms:
- **Atomic Number** = Number of protons  
- **Mass Number** = Protons + Neutrons  
- **Isotopes** = Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons  
- **Ions** = Atoms that have lost or gained electrons

### 🔹 Electron Configuration:
Electrons are arranged in shells around the nucleus.  
Example for Sodium (Na):  
- Atomic number = 11  
- Electron configuration: 2, 8, 1

The structure of atoms determines how they bond and form compounds.

{
  title: 'Chemical Bonding',
  content: `
**Chemical Bonding** is the process by which atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. It involves the interaction of electrons in the outermost shell (valence electrons).

### 🔹 Types of Chemical Bonds:

1. **Ionic Bonding**:
   - Occurs between a metal and a non-metal.
   - Involves the transfer of electrons.
   - One atom loses electrons (becomes a positive ion), and the other gains electrons (becomes a negative ion).
   - Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl)

2. **Covalent Bonding**:
   - Occurs between two non-metals.
   - Involves sharing of electrons.
   - Atoms share pairs of electrons to achieve stability.
   - Example: Water (H₂O), Carbon dioxide (CO₂)

3. **Metallic Bonding**:
   - Occurs between metal atoms.
   - Electrons are free to move in a "sea of electrons."
   - This explains properties like conductivity and malleability.
   - Example: Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe)

### 🔹 Why Do Atoms Bond?
- To achieve a **stable electronic configuration**, usually a full outer shell.
- Atoms follow the **Octet Rule**: most atoms tend to have eight electrons in their outer shell.

### 🔹 Characteristics of Bonds:
- **Ionic compounds**: High melting points, conduct electricity in molten or dissolved form.
- **Covalent compounds**: Low melting points, poor conductors.
- **Metallic substances**: Good conductors, shiny, ductile.

The **rate of a chemical reaction** refers to how fast or slow a reaction takes place. Some reactions happen instantly (like explosions), while others take time (like rusting).

---

### 🔹 **Factors Affecting Rate of Reaction**:

1. **Concentration**  
   - Increasing concentration of reactants usually increases the rate.
   - More particles = more collisions.

2. **Temperature**  
   - Higher temperature = faster reaction.
   - Particles move faster and collide more frequently and energetically.

3. **Surface Area**  
   - Smaller particle size = larger surface area.
   - More area exposed = faster reaction.

4. **Catalyst**  
   - A substance that speeds up a reaction without being used up.
   - Lowers activation energy.

5. **Pressure (for gases)**  
   - Increasing pressure increases reaction rate.
   - Particles are forced closer together.

---

### 🔹 **Measuring Rate of Reaction**:
- **Volume of gas produced** over time.
- **Change in mass** of reactants or products.
- **Time taken** for a change in color or appearance.

---

### 🔹 **Examples**:
