    title: 'Parts of Speech',
    content: `
In English, every word belongs to a category called a Part of Speech. There are 8 main parts of speech:

1. **Noun** – A person, place, thing, or idea.  
   Example: _boy, Nigeria, happiness_

2. **Pronoun** – A word that replaces a noun.  
   Example: _he, she, it, they_

3. **Verb** – An action or a state of being.  
   Example: _run, eat, is, are_

4. **Adjective** – Describes a noun or pronoun.  
   Example: _beautiful, red, tall_

5. **Adverb** – Describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb.  
   Example: _quickly, very, well_

6. **Preposition** – Shows relationship between noun/pronoun and other words.  
   Example: _in, on, under, beside_

7. **Conjunction** – Connects words or sentences.  
   Example: _and, but, because, although_

8. **Interjection** – Expresses emotion.  
   Example: _Wow! Oh! Alas!_

Understanding these helps us write and speak better English.

👉 In conclusion, parts of speech help us organize and understand how sentences work. Mastering them is the first step to mastering English grammar.

  title: 'Sentence Structure',
  content: `
English sentences follow specific patterns that help us communicate clearly. The basic sentence structure includes:

1. **Subject** – Who or what the sentence is about.  
   Example: _The boy_, _She_

2. **Verb (Predicate)** – What the subject does.  
   Example: _runs_, _is eating_

3. **Object** – Receives the action (not always needed).  
   Example: _She reads **a book**._

**Types of Sentences:**
- **Simple Sentence** – One independent clause.  
  Example: _She sleeps early._

- **Compound Sentence** – Two independent clauses joined by a conjunction.  
  Example: _He came home, and he cooked dinner._

- **Complex Sentence** – One independent clause and one or more dependent clauses.  
  Example: _Although it rained, we played football._

Understanding sentence structures helps avoid fragments or run-on sentences.

  title: 'Concord (Subject-Verb Agreement)',
  content: `
**Concord** means agreement between the **subject** and the **verb** in a sentence.

👉 If the subject is singular, the verb must be singular.  
👉 If the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.

### Rules:

1. **Singular Subject + Singular Verb**  
   Example: _He **goes** to school._

2. **Plural Subject + Plural Verb**  
   Example: _They **go** to school._

3. **Subjects joined by 'and' take plural verb**  
   Example: _John and Mary **are** friends._

4. **When two subjects are joined by 'or' or 'nor', the verb agrees with the nearest subject**  
   Example: _Neither the teacher nor the students **are** here._

5. **Uncountable nouns take singular verbs**  
   Example: _Milk **is** good for the body._

6. **Collective nouns (team, family, etc.) usually take singular verbs**  
   Example: _The team **is** winning._

7. **Some words may look plural but are singular**  
   Example: _Mathematics **is** difficult._

Concord is essential for writing grammatically correct sentences.

  title: 'Figures of Speech',
  content: `
**Figures of speech** are creative ways of using words to express meaning beyond the literal interpretation. They make writing more interesting and vivid.

### Common Figures of Speech:

1. **Simile** – A comparison using “like” or “as”.  
   Example: _She is **as beautiful as** a rose._

2. **Metaphor** – A direct comparison without using “like” or “as”.  
   Example: _Time is **a thief**._

3. **Personification** – Giving human qualities to non-human things.  
   Example: _The wind **whispered** through the trees._

4. **Hyperbole** – An exaggeration used for emphasis.  
   Example: _I’ve told you **a million times**!_

5. **Onomatopoeia** – Words that imitate sounds.  
   Example: _The **buzzing** of bees._

6. **Alliteration** – Repetition of the same starting sounds in words.  
   Example: _Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers._

7. **Oxymoron** – Two opposite ideas used together.  
   Example: _**Bittersweet**, deafening silence._

8. **Irony** – Saying the opposite of what you mean.
