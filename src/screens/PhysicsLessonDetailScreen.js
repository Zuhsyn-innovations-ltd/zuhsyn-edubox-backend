  title: 'Work, Energy and Power',
  content: `
These are fundamental concepts in physics that explain how objects move and interact with force.

🔹 **Work (W)**  
Work is done when a **force** causes a **displacement** of an object.  
**Formula:** W = F × d × cos(θ)  
- W = Work (Joules)
- F = Force (Newtons)
- d = Distance (meters)
- θ = Angle between force and direction of motion

**Examples:**  
- Lifting a book  
- Pushing a cart  
> If there is no movement, no work is done.

🔹 **Energy (E)**  
Energy is the **capacity to do work**. It exists in various forms:  
- **Kinetic Energy (KE)** – Energy of motion → KE = ½mv²  
- **Potential Energy (PE)** – Stored energy → PE = mgh  
- **Thermal, Chemical, Nuclear, Sound, Light** – Other forms of energy

🔹 **Power (P)**  
Power is the **rate at which work is done**.  
**Formula:** P = W / t  
- P = Power (Watts)
- W = Work (Joules)
- t = Time (seconds)

🔹 **Energy Conversion**  
Energy can be converted from one form to another.  
Example: Electrical energy → Light in a bulb

🔹 **Law of Conservation of Energy**  
> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only converted from one form to another.

Understanding work, energy, and power helps us in machines, electricity, and daily activities.

V = I × R
\`\`\`
Where:
- V = Voltage
- I = Current
- R = Resistance

2. **Current Electricity** – Charges move in a continuous path (used in appliances)

---

🧲 **Magnetism**

Magnetism is the force exerted by magnets when they attract or repel each other.

- **Magnets** have two poles: **North** and **South**
- Like poles **repel**, unlike poles **attract**
- A magnetic field is the invisible area around a magnet where its force is felt

---

🔁 **Electromagnetism**
- When electric current flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field.
- This is used in **electromagnets**, **electric motors**, **generators**, and **transformers**.

---

🔌 **Uses in Daily Life**
- Charging phones (electricity)
- Fans, TVs, bulbs (electric circuits)
- Credit card strips, electric bells, MRI (magnetism)
